# Python-Working-With-Files
This program demonstrates reading from and writing to a file

The purpose of this Python program was to manage employee data using a dictionary-based data structure. I focused on several key programming concepts and skills, including data structures, file I/O, and interacting with users. An Employee class was created to encapsulate Employee data, with getter and setter methods for manipulating this data.
